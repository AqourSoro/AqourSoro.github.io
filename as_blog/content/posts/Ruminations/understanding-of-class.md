## Preface

The history of human society is the history of class struggle. This is a critical understanding in Marxist theory regarding the development of human society. As a student of Marxism and a Marxist, one cannot study history to draw lessons without understanding class struggle. To comprehend class struggle, it is essential to grasp the concept of "class," especially its origins, development, dissolution, and essence. Only by thoroughly understanding these aspects can one gain a clear view of human societal evolution and the true meaning of communism.

## The Birth of Class

To understand the structure of "class" in society, one must revisit human history and analyze specific phenomena and characteristics. From a materialist perspective, the starting point of human history is the moment when humans began producing their own means of subsistence. This act distinguishes humans from animals. As Marx stated in *The German Ideology*: "Man produces his means of subsistence, and thereby indirectly produces his material life itself." <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> This production emerged alongside population growth and was based on interactions between individuals, which were in turn determined by production.

In the earliest primitive society, humans relied mainly on gathering and hunting for survival, using simple tools provided by nature. Archaeological studies indicate that early humans of the Paleolithic era had mastered the ability to craft and use stone tools, forming the earliest kinship-based family structures. These families were often matrilineal, with close relatives marrying within the same group. In the later Paleolithic period, improved tools significantly enhanced productivity, and loose groups evolved into more stable clan communes. As Engels described in *The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State*, clan communes featured collective labor, communal property ownership, and democratically elected chieftains <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. At this stage, production relations were characterized by a primitive communist system, free of exploitation and oppression, though productivity remained extremely low.

The development of productivity drove social transformations. By the late primitive era, humans entered the metal tool age, where agricultural advancements significantly boosted productivity. The division of labor between agriculture and pastoralism led to surplus products and social inequalities. For example, Engels pointed out that with increased productivity, "producers were alienated as part of the means of production," marking the beginning of private property <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. The formation of slavery concentrated control over land, labor, and surplus products into the hands of a few.

Furthermore, the necessity of changes in production relations driven by productivity can be observed in historical transitions. For instance, during the shift from slavery to feudalism, advances in agricultural techniques and the widespread use of iron tools led to the rise of small-scale farming. The large estates characteristic of slavery became unsustainable, and serfdom, based on peasant dependency on feudal lords, replaced the old slave-master relationship <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. This transformation illustrates how increased productivity inevitably reshapes production relations, driving social evolution.
