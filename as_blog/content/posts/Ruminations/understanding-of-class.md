## Preface

The history of human society is, at its core, the history of class struggle. This is a fundamental understanding in Marxist theory about the development of society. As a student of Marxism and a Marxist myself, studying class struggle is essential to learning from history and gaining a deeper understanding of human progress. To truly understand class struggle, we must first grasp the concept of "class"—its origins, development, eventual disappearance, and essence. Only by mastering these ideas can we clearly see how human society has evolved and understand the true meaning of communism.



## The Birth of Class

To understand class as a structure of human society, we must revisit the history of human civilization and examine it through its specific characteristics. From a materialist perspective, the defining moment of human history—and what sets humans apart from animals—is the beginning of producing their own means of subsistence. According to Marx in *The German Ideology*, when humans produce their means of subsistence, they also indirectly produce their material existence itself[^1]. Moreover, this process began alongside population growth and was based on interactions between individuals, which were in turn determined by production. These interactions are what we commonly refer to as production relations, or social relations. In addition, human production inherently involves transforming nature to acquire the resources necessary for survival. The process of labor, therefore, represents the interaction between humans and nature—what we call natural relations. Generally, these natural relations are measured by humans' ability to conquer nature and produce the resources needed for life, referred to as productive forces. Productive forces and production relations form a contradictory unity: productive forces determine production relations, while production relations react back upon productive forces. From this perspective, we can reinterpret the history of human society through the lens of productive forces and production relations.

### Primitive Society

Let us begin with an overview of primitive society. At this time, early humans primarily used simple, natural tools, and their main sources of food were gathering and hunting. The concept of family did not yet exist. Around three million years ago, humans gradually learned to craft and use chipped stone tools, marking the beginning of the Paleolithic era.

During the early and middle stages of the Paleolithic era, humans not only learned to make stone tools but also formed kinship-based families, with marriages occurring between close relatives within the same generation. A well-known example in Chinese mythology is Fuxi and Nüwa.

By the late Paleolithic era, humans had mastered the creation of more advanced and refined tools, significantly improving productivity. Loose groups began to evolve into clan communes. Clan communes were composed of members with a common ancestor, bound by blood relations, and prohibited internal marriages. They shared a common language and totemic beliefs. At the same time, they practiced democracy: all clan members could speak and discuss issues equally, and chieftains were elected and could be replaced if necessary. The most critical means of production were communally owned. Everyone worked together, and the production materials were equally shared, with mutual aid being an obligation among clan members.

From this, we can roughly understand the basic characteristics of primitive society. Production relations were based on a primitive communist system of communal ownership, with no wealth disparity, oppression, or exploitation. However, the productive forces of the society were extremely underdeveloped. According to the contradictory unity of productive forces and production relations, this primitive communism was destined to be replaced by other production relations as productive forces advanced.

### The Late Primitive Society

In the late stage of primitive society, humans entered the Metal Age. Significant advancements in agricultural tools led to a major development in agriculture, dramatically increasing productivity. This marked the first great division of labor in human society. Due to differences in natural conditions, society gradually split into agricultural tribes in fertile river basins and nomadic tribes in areas unsuitable for farming.

This division of labor initially enhanced productivity, enabling both agricultural and nomadic tribes to produce surplus goods beyond their basic survival needs. Agricultural tribes and nomadic tribes began exchanging surplus goods to further meet their respective needs.

At the same time, the abundance of subsistence resources allowed prisoners from tribal conflicts—previously killed—to be preserved as slaves and used as labor. Thus, slavery was born. This abundance, however, relied heavily on the physical capabilities of the producers, i.e., their labor power. This labor method, which highlighted human physiological differences, improved productivity but also diminished the advantages of collective labor.

In other words, in the absence of additional factors, assigning more advanced production tools to physically stronger laborers maximized the acquisition of subsistence resources. As a result, the collective labor of the primitive communal system was gradually replaced by small-scale and individual labor. This labor was based on the private ownership of production tools, and the control over surplus subsistence also began to shift. It was during this period that private property emerged[^2].
